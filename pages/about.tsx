          We're a tiny two-person creative co-op.
          Working with startups has made us fall in love with the early stages of product development.
          Unlike traditional startups racing to scale,
          Husk is taking a different path:
          we plan to stay small, creative, and focused on our projects.
          If one gets too big for us, we'll find it a new home.
          Until then we'll keep making things that we think should be in the world and having fun.
